## Introduction
This paper discusses using Functions in a relational database like Microsoft SQL Server.  SQL User-Defined Functions (“UDFs”) are routines that accept parameters, perform actions, and return the result as a value, just like Functions in other programming languages.  Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions can return values as a single result or in tables, and each has some unique syntax.
